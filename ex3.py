# Print the Roosters. PEMDAS, Multiplication then Modulus then subtraction
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# Print that I will count eggs
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# PEMDAS modulus 4 % 2 then 1/4 both of which equal 0. Then just add and subtract left to right.

# Print a math question
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
